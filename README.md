## ARX testing

## 

On the left, an RS485 module that plugs into a USB port on a PC. 
Windows drivers will automatically
make it look like a "COM<n>" port to software. 

On the right is a tiny microcontroller evaluation board that
carries almost the same processor as is used on the ARX Board. It runs
exactly the same software, allowing it to respond to commands just as an
actual ARX Board would. 

The small board in the middle is an RS485 to TTL converter that allows 
the processor on the eval board to communicate on the RS485 bus.
